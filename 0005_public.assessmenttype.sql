The Customer Centricity™ (CC) assessment measures your organization's alignment to execute a customer centric strategy.\n<br><br>\nThe results provide a snapshot of your current alignment with four scales:  the degree of empowerment allowed your employees in dealing with customers, the efficacy of your customer interface processes, the strength of customer focused processes in every part of your organization, and whether the organization’s learning process is geared toward customers or to job and technical enhancement. Each of these scales are key aspects of executing a customer centric strategy. \n<br><br>\nThis assessment consists of 12 questions, taking no more than 5 minutes to complete.  Please answer all questions from your own perspective and experience in this organization.\n<br><br>\nAll individual results are kept completely anonymous and confidential and will never be shared on an individual basis.\n<br><br>\nThank you,\n<br><br>\nStrategia Analytics Team	Thank you for responding to this assessment.
